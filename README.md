# RxMartianChess
MartianChess implemented with React

Generally, I've taken React JS tutorial, rewritten it to TS and got the logic from PyMartianChess that I've created some time ago.

You can try it out on https://www.syrkin.com/MartianChess/

TODO:
- Add the following check: 
a player may not immediately reverse an opponent's last move (i.e. may not move the piece across the canal back to its departure square, on the next turn).
- Field promotions:
If you have no Queens, you can create one by moving a Drone into a Pawnâ€™s space (or vice versa) and merging them. Similarly, if you have no Drones, you can make one by merging two of
your Pawns. (The pieces being merged should be removed from the board immediately and swapped for a piece of the combined size.)
